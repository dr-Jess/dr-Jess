### Hi there 👋, I'm Jesse!

#### As of October 2024, I am:
- A computer information sciences student at the University of Pennsylvania
- A backend dev for [Penn Labs](https://pennlabs.org/)

<be>

#### Some things I've done before:
- Backend engineering intern @Simplify--mostly working with FastAPI and production databases (PostgreSQL)
- LLM & Cybersecurity Research at Penn (see LinkedIn or resume for more)
- Lots of interesting projects! This github is a good first place to look
<be>

#### I'm particularly passionate about:
- Data structures and algorithms! Not a joke, I find these problems extremely interesting
- DB and data modeling. I love relational DB 😄 they're the greatest invention of all time
- Networks and cybersecurity
- ...and learning! I'm always down to learn something new
