<be>

#### I'm particularly passionate about:
- Data structures and algorithms! Not a joke, I find these problems extremely interesting
- DB and data modeling. I love relational DB ðŸ˜„ they're the greatest invention of all time
- Compilers and other theoretical interests
- ...and learning! I'm always down to learn something new
